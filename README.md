# Untitled Physics Game (LÖVE)
School project haha

It's like angry birds, but you throw boxes as other stacks of boxes, off the screen.

## Running
Obtain LÖVE. Run, within this directory:

`love .`

Dragging the folder over the LÖVE runtime works too.

## Prototype
There is a prototype in _prototype.lua. Rename it to main.lua and run...

## Stuff used
- LÖVE game framework
	- Box2D physics library as part of LÖVE's physics module
- breezefield (wrapper around LÖVE's physics module)
- json.lua (Lua JSON (de)serialisation library)
